                A digital safe for storing documents and information about your
                most valued belongings in one place, such as property documents,

              <h2>My contribution</h2>
              <p>
                I started on this project as a frontend developer and moved to
                the UX side after some team restructuring. As a UX/UI designer I
                was mainly working on workflows and high fidelity mockups.

          <h1>Problem</h1>
          <p>
            Not having your documents organised in a secure centralised way may
            lead to issues, especially in cases where the unexpected might
            happen:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Natural disasters.</b> Having only physical copies of your
            documents can lead to problems in case of fire or flooding.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Accidents and health.</b> In the unfortunate event of an accident
            or sickness, family members might need to access your documents or
            important information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Missing important documents.</b> Many people tend to postpone or
            avoid tasks related to unpleasant topics, such as preparing a will
            or a living trust.
          </p>
          <h1>Solution</h1>
          <p>
            A secure place - digital safe - for your documents and information
            that is easily accessible and sharable with your closest people.
          </p>

              <h1>Automating</h1>
              <p>
                Organising documents is not a fun task for most people, so our
                first priority was to automate as much of the process as
                possible so that the users wonâ€™t have to enter information
                manually.
              </p>
              <p>
                We presented an option to retrieve information automatically
                from the property and vehicle registers.
              </p>

              <h1>Sharing</h1>
              <p>
                The ability to share information was an important functionality
                that we paid a lot of attention to.
              </p>
              <p>
                We added options for users to share their information on
                different levels - they could share the whole safe, a specific
                section or only certain files.

              <h1>Encouragement</h1>

                <b>Tips.</b> New users were greeted with tips helping them find
                a starting point as well as explaining in what situations having
                certain information filled out might be useful.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Articles.</b> We added some articles for more complicated
                topics such as where to start when you are thinking about making
                a will or in what cases it might be useful to have your assets
                documented.
